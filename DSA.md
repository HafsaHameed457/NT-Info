## BIG 0 Notation

Runtime requireed to run a function

It is a language which we use to tell a function about how long will an algorithm take to run.

     O(N)= n increases no of operations also increases.
     O(1)= Constant time flat line
     O(N!)= We are adding nested loops for each variable of algo.

## Algo efficiency

As the elements increases how many operations do we have to do. Scalability means as we grow bigger and bigger how slow will the program run.
