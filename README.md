# Nodejs-interview-questions

## What is node js
The Node.js runtime is an environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server, outside of a web browser. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine (from Google Chrome), Node.js is fast and efficient at executing JavaScript code.


## Key Components of Node.js Runtime:

1. JavaScript Engine (V8): Compiles and runs JavaScript code, optimizing for high performance.

2. Event Loop: Manages asynchronous operations, handling multiple tasks (like file operations, network requests) without blocking the main thread.

3. Non-Blocking I/O: Uses asynchronous, non-blocking input/output operations to handle multiple requests simultaneously, making it ideal for real-time applications.

4. Built-in Modules: Provides core modules (like fs for file systems, http for creating servers) that offer common functionalities directly, without needing third-party libraries.

## Why Node.js?

Node.js’s runtime allows developers to use JavaScript on both the front end and back end, creating full-stack applications with a single language. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture is particularly suited for building scalable applications, like APIs, real-time chat apps, and microservices.

## Difference between backend and frontend

The frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly — it includes everything users see, click, or type (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

The backend is the server-side part that handles data processing, storage, and business logic — it manages databases, server operations, and APIs that communicate with the frontend.

## Difference between NODE JS AND JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript:

1. Runs in the browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. Primarily used for frontend development, manipulating the DOM and handling user interactions.
3. Limited to browser capabilities (no direct access to files, OS, or network outside the browser).

Node.js:

1. A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.
2. Used for backend development, building APIs, servers, and handling file systems.
3. Has access to the operating system, file system, and network, thanks to built-in modules like fs, http, etc.
